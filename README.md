# My Portfolio

A portfolio of projects built during the full time, 12 week [*_nology*](https://nology.io/) software developer course, and ongoing work. Building a portfolio page was originally one of the projects assigned in week three of the course, and that original portfolio has since been updated and rebuilt using React.
